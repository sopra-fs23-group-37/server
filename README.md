## Technologies
- HTTP/Rest
- gradle, spring, java and mysql google cloud database
- github, sonarqube and google cloud

## High-level components
- Websocket: Socket.java uses the springframework.web.socket library to transfer data easily and in real-time for the users, round and game overall.
- Database: Application.java uses the jpa interface to store all kinds of information in a remote google cloud mySQL server.

## Launch & Deployment
### First get to know Spring Boot
Before you set up the environment, get to know Spring Boot and what REST is
- [Spring-Boot documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/index.html)
- [Spring Guides](http://spring.io/guides)
    - [Building a RESTful Web Service](http://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/)
    - [Building REST services with Spring](http://spring.io/guides/tutorials/bookmarks/)

### Setup with your IDE of choice
Download your IDE of choice:
- [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
- [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Or any other IDE


Make Sure ```Java 15``` is installed on your system <br/>
-> **For Windows Users:** please make sure your ```JAVA_HOME``` environment variable is set to the correct version of Java

1. File -> Open... -> server
2. Accept to import the project as a ``gradle project`` <br/><br/>
   Then build the project in your IDE
3. Right click the ```build.gradle``` file and choose ```Run Build```

### Setup for VS Code
The following extensions will help you to run it more easily:
- `pivotal.vscode-spring-boot`
- `vscjava.vscode-spring-initializr`
- `vscjava.vscode-spring-boot-dashboard`
- `vscjava.vscode-java-pack`
- `richardwillis.vscode-gradle` <br/><br/>
  **Note for VS Code Users:** You'll need to build the project first with Gradle, just click on the `build` command in the _Gradle Tasks_ extension. Then check the _Spring Boot Dashboard_ extension if it already shows `soprafs22` and hit the play button to start the server. If it doesn't show up, restart VS Code and check again.

### Building with Gradle
You can use the local Gradle Wrapper to build the application.
-   macOS: `./gradlew`
-   Linux: `./gradlew`
-   Windows: `./gradlew.bat`

You can get more Information about [Gradle Wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) and [Gradle](https://gradle.org/docs/) if you want.

### Build the application
Run in the server file in your terminal
```
./gradlew build
```

### Run the local deployment
```
./gradlew bootRun
```
### Run the tests

```
./gradlew test
```
### Database
You have to take no arrangements for the database. The database will be running automatically.

## Roadmap
1. In the future, you could add a speed mode, where the users had limited time to play a move and could set that before the game start.
2. In addition, it would be nice to have a spectate mode, where other player could watch the card game.
3. It would also be interesting if users could also use a chat function in the game.
